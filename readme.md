# Zephyr Language

Zephyr is a general purpose, optionally-typed, interpreted language written in C#.  

Using VSCode? Try the badly made VSCode syntax highlighting [VSCode Syntax Highlighter](https://github.com/itevie/zephyr-vscode-syntax-highlighting)  

To learn how to use this language, check out the Wiki section on GitHub.
